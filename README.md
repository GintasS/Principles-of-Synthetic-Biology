We might be able to program cells in the same way we program computers.
Computer might be able to translate these high level biological programs into say biological regulatory networks.

Abstract regulatory network -> DNA sequence -> into the cell.

#### Possible real-life Applications
- Detect (and kill) HeLa cancer cells (Cancer)
- Vaccination using regulated antigen/adjuvant production (Infectious diseases)
- Self-timed, multi-step hiPs to B-cell differentation (Programmable Organoids)
- Rare diseases, DNA Vaccines
- Cell-based therapies, Beta cells
- Biomanufacturing
- Drug development
- Diagnostics
- Water supply crises
- Land and Waterway misuse
- Food Shortage Crises
- Rising Greenhouse Gas Emissions

#### Intro

How do we go from wanting a cell to do X to having the cell do X? We need to apply principles of design to engineer the circuit that lets the cell do X. We need computational tools to analyze the circuit, get intuition about it or confirm our expectations. We can then have the DNA encoding the circuit synthesized and test it in cells. Since these circuits are likely to be complex, we will need several iterations of design, debugging, analysis etc. This cannot happen in an ad hoc way, we need principles to follow for this to be efficient!

Exposing cells to various factors for them to mutate.

#### What is synthetic biology?
- An emerging engineering discipline that seeks to make implementation of new biological function vastly more efficient, reliable, transparent and safe.
- A field dedicated to biologically engineered solutions to world problems in health, energy, environment, and security.

#### What is different between SB and GE?
>My understanding is that synthetic biology is genetic engineering 2.0. The difference is in the approach. Whereas genetic engineering projects are usually ad hoc, synthetic biology aims to apply proper engineering principles such as standardisation, modularisation, and reusability. Synthetic biologists create and use libraries of standard parts that are characterised, so they can be easily reused in projects. A part could be a gene, a terminator, a promoter, etc.

>Synthetic biology also has greater ambitions. The focus is on creating whole systems/circuits of genetic regulation. This means there is a need for computational modelling and understanding of how biological systems work. In this aspect synthetic biology is a sister of systems biology a bit like synthetic chemistry (engineering) is a sister of chemistry (science).

>You could of course argue that it's just a marketing ploy to invent a new name for something that is just the next step in genetic engineering, but the differences in approach are quite large and a new name signifies it.

>With regards to synthesised vs. PCRed DNA: It doesn't really matter which you use in synthetic biology. However, cheap synthesis is one of the technologies that enable easier synthetic biology. The idea for the future is that you will be able to synthesise whole plasmids and chromosomes instead of having to "cut and paste" DNA. When that happens physical parts repositories will be obsolete, but they will remain crucial in silico. Cheap synthesis is nice, but doesn't make or brake synthetic biology.

#### Top-down design

In order to deal with challenges arising from complexity of systems, engineers break down the systems into smaller, more manageable pieces hierarchically.

Biology is not necessarily Boolean (digital) as we hope. The cell uses electrical, chemical, and mechanical currencies in non-digital ways. Perhaps we need different paradigms for different components and layers.
